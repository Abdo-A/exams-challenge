This project is an implementation of a Frontend challenge.

It consists of a frontend and a backend. The backend is only a basic node js service.
The frontend is in the folder client_react.

Only one very basic test is done, using jest.

Only one components library was used in this application: semantic-ui-react

To run the application, make sure you are in the root folder then do:
npm install
npm run client_install
npm run server
npm run client
