This project is an implementation of a Frontend challenge.

It consists of a frontend and a backend. The backend is only a basic node js service, with mongoDB.

The frontend is in the folder client_react.

Only one very basic test is done, using jest.

Only one components library was used in this application: semantic-ui-react

All the code is written by me, there is no auto-generated code.

To run the application, make sure you are in the root folder then do:

npm install

npm run client_install

npm run server

npm run client
